# RNFLD (Retinal Nerve Fibre Defect) Detection Using Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks in Retinal Fundus Imaging

A Pitt CSC Hacks Project

# ♛ ♛ Project Background ♛ ♛

# What are RNFLDs?

The Retinal Nerve Fibre Layer (RNFL) is the surface layer of the retina in the inner part (fundus) of the eye

RNFL defects is thinning or damage to this layer, and shows up on imaging as dark wedges

#  ♛ ♛ Why do we care?  ♛ ♛

Glaucoma is the leading cause of **irreversible** blindness in the world
  - Treatments are available to slow disease progression but only with early detection

The International Council of Ophthalmology prioritizes (optic) cup size and **RNFL defects** as early indications of glaucoma

Most research in the field follows optic cup and optic disk trends in glaucoma
  - However, RNFL damage **precedes** detectable optic disc changes and visual field loss _[1]_


#  ♛ ♛ Methods ♛ ♛

We will be running our code against publicly available datasets online

We will utilize the Tensorflow Keras API for Deep Learning with Python and popular python libraries

# ♛ ♛ Goals and Challenges ♛ ♛

We want our model to be able to detect images with and without signs of RNFL defects

We want our model to also generate heatmaps of the areas with defects in the images

This is certainly a challenging topic with many obstacles that will present themselves as we work

This project will require high levels of machine learning and deep learning knowledge as well as Python mastery
